# The way I learned Linux 

I started my computer crash course during the start of the covid lockdowns with a [Raspberry Pi 4b](https://www.raspberrypi.com/). Being self-taught it was the best way to start since I had no previous experience with computers and the cost of failure was low.

---

Since then I have mastered turning a server into a fully customized desktop using [Qtile](http://www.qtile.org/) as my window manager and this took some time to get used to, but well worth the effort if you like the speed of transitioning from project to project.

---

The downside of being self-taught is you have no sense of direction on what to focus on. 

---

Since those first few years, I have configured [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) several times and honestly, I believe it is the best. It  takes a long time to configure it the way you want,  with all the possibilities it has to offer. Since I didn't use [GitHub](https://github.com/brandonjanssen) at the time to save all my configs, I would have to learn it over and over again. Like I had to do with all the other programs I installed, until I found the power of  [GitHub](https://github.com). 

---

Focus is key with any tech and I have been focusing on the wrong things, my focus on Linux has been good but I have spent too much time on the configurations of Linux and not learning the tech that helps create.

---

I have focus now and that is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and UI/UX this makes sense to me since I like tinkering with configs, what could be better than building websites to let out all my creativity.

My real passion is Blockchain and now [Agoric](https://agoric.com/) lets you write DEFI contracts in JavaScript, so I think this is a great opportunity to use all of the languages I mentioned above and put them to good use.
