#  [Strategies On Fusion  ](https://fusion.novanetwork.io/#/)
[Nova Network](https://novanetwork.io/ecosystem) Is a different kind of protocol , no crazy APY or APR, built for long term success #GrownUpDeFi.

5 Years is a long time, but. This protocol started during a bear market, so it could take five years before the markets make a full comeback, nice time to stack your bags. I take these rewards and I reinvest into [SNT/NUSD Yeild Farm](https://fusion.novanetwork.io/#/farms/SNT/0x1F5396f254EE25377A5C1b9c6BfF5f44e9294fFF)



### SNT/NUSD Yeild Farm

>Then i take the  [SNT/NUSD Yeild Farm](https://fusion.novanetwork.io/#/farms/SNT/0x1F5396f254EE25377A5C1b9c6BfF5f44e9294fFF) rewards then invest it into the  [**3 Months MaturityÂ Bond Staking Pool.**](https://fusion.novanetwork.io/#/bond-staking/pool/2) I use this as it gives me the best return in a short period of time. Then i repeat it over and over












As you can see their is couple ways that you can make your money work for you, if your willing to commit.


I think this protocol has potential due to low supply of 60,000,000 tokens, the exact amount is not known. 

There is a substantial price difference between OnChain and OffChain. ***OnChain as of 10-16-2022  show a price of $0.012588 per 1 $SNT.  OffChain being***  **[Firebird Finance ](https://app.firebird.finance/swap)** ***on Fantom #FTM with a price of  $0.006375  as of  10-16-2022  that's a nice arbitrage.***

### Paid to do it
What i am doing is buying on Fantom and Bridging it to NovaNetwork which is a free transaction, then selling the difference for $NUSD then you decide what you want to do. All i can say is as of right now you are getting paid to buy $SNT  on Fantom if you  bridge it to the NovaNetwork and sell half for $NUSD.

>- Low Market Cap, could = to the moon if it gets traction.
>
>- All of what i have illustrated, pays you native $SNT and $WSNT
>
>- It is nice to able loop your investment
