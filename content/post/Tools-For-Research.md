# Wallet Tracking
- [DeBank](https://debank.com) you put your wallet address here to see your investments.This is not small block-chain friendly.If you use this correctly you can enter other wallet  addresses and see what they are investing in.
- [Nansen Portfolio](https://portfolio.nansen.ai/) this is probably the best wallet tracker, also gives analytics of the tokens that you hold.
- [Tin.Network](https://tin.network/en/dashboard), I only use this to track wallets on Harmony ONE.  
## Defi Dashboard
-  [Nanoly](https://nanoly.com/) this is good for searching farms with good APY's or APR
- [Defillama](https://defillama.com/)  is a overview of all of DEFI
## Trading View
- [DEX Screener](https://dexscreener.com/) search most popular #EVM chain and their coins  and they have been adding #IBC chains as well of lately.
- [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) token search engine must use.
- [Gecko Terminal](https://geckoterminal.com/) use this like dex screener, this had a recent overhaul and i think its better than [dexscreener ](https://dexscreener.com/) now.
- [Nomics](https://nomics.com) use this like dex screener but for small unknown coins.
- [Trading View](https://www.tradingview.com) is a important tool, you can see futures,stocks,bonds,commodities,cyrpto it does a lot. You have to make a account to use it.
## Researching 
- [Dune](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards) for deep research.
- [Messari](https://messari.io) is another great tool for research.
