# Wallet Tracking
- [DeBank](https://debank.com) you put your wallet address here to see your investments.This is not ONE,MTV,ECH or small block-chain friendly.If you use this correctly you can enter other wallets addresses and see what they are investing in,,people with millions
- [Nansen Portfolio](https://portfolio.nansen.ai/) this is probably the best wallet tracker, also gives analytics of your tokens.
- [Tin.Network](https://tin.network/en/dashboard), I only track <tag>ONE</tag> tokens with this app.  
## Defi Dashboard
-  [Nanoly](https://nanoly.com/) this is good for searching farms with good APY's or APR
- [Defillama](https://defillama.com/) just click this link and you will see what it can do for you 
## Trading View
- [DEX Screener](https://dexscreener.com/) search most popular #EVM chain and their coins  and they have been adding #IBC chains as well of lately.
- [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) token search engine must use.
- [Gecko Terminal](https://geckoterminal.com/) use this like dex screener, this had a recent overhaul add its better than dexscreener now.
- [Nomics](https://nomics.com) use this like dex screener but for small unknown coins, good for MTV, ECH tokens
- [Trading View](https://www.tradingview.com) is a important tool, much better than dex screener,you can see futures,stocks,bonds,commodities,cyrpto it does a lot.You have to make a account to use it,but if you have my email and password i all ready have it setup.
