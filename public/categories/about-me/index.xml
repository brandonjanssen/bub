      <title>How I am evolving since I learned linux </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my computer crash course during the start of the covid lockdowns with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.com/&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi 4b&lt;/a&gt;. Being self-taught it was the best way to start since I had no previous experience with computers and the cost of failure was low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then I have mastered turning a server into a fully customized desktop using &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.qtile.org/&#34;&gt;Qtile&lt;/a&gt; as my window manager and this took some time to get used to, but well worth the effort if you like the speed of transitioning from project to project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downside of being self-taught is you have no sense of direction on what to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since those first few years, I have configured &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; several times and honestly, I believe it is the best. It  takes a long time to configure it the way you want,  with all the possibilities it has to offer. Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/brandonjanssen&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; at the time to save all my configs, I would have to learn it over and over again. Like I had to do with all the other programs I installed, until I found the power of  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus is key with any tech and I have been focusing on the wrong things, my focus on Linux has been good but I have spent too much time on the configurations of Linux and not learning the tech that helps create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have focus now and that is HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and UI/UX this makes sense to me since I like tinkering with configs, what could be better than building websites to let out all my creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 10-12-2022 i have created my first website. Focusing on design first and now starting to create  content. All posts with the exception of this one are incomplete as of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10-16-2022&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;list-of-things-to-complete-are-the-following&#34;&gt;List of things to complete are the following.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add some content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a Logo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a comments sections to each page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See if i can create a eCommerce page using a static  website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would like to add a section for just Crypto, like a page for best farm APR&amp;rsquo;s and APY&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A  Linux and a opensource guide page to find useful tools would be nice for beginners that have a hard time finding there needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://agoric.com/&#34;&gt;Agoric&lt;/a&gt; lets you write DEFI contracts in JavaScript, so I think this is a great opportunity to use all of the languages I mentioned above and put them to good use.&lt;/p&gt;
