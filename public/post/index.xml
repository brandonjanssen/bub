      <description>Text To Arch Script With Excalidraw On Obsidian First we need to install excalidraw on obsidian. This is the link for Excalidraw GitHub and it will show quite a bit of info, but you will want to install it from community plugins page in setting and you will have to turn on restricted mode.
In the top right button that looks like settings icon click that and it will bring up all the scripts available to install, the text arch script was close to the bottom of the page.</description>

Since then I have mastered turning a server into a fully customized desktop using Qtile as my window manager and this took some time to get used to, but well worth the effort if you like the speed of transitioning from project to project.</description>
